## Problem Statement/Applications
It is important nowadays to use 3D construction technique to reshape scanned drone images for either better detecting, testing or developing during engineering domain. The topic is about how to improve the quality and speed when we use innovative methods to construct 3D point clouds. 3D point clouds [1]mean 3D Machine Vision captures an object’s location and shape in a format suitable for processing by a computer or a PAC/PLC.  An object’s surface is represented by a list of three-dimensional coordinates (X, Y, Z), referred to as a “Point Cloud.”

It is useful in terms of using digital simulation to develop system without taking risk of physical destroy or cost in reality. For example, digital twins is one of the application of 3D construction goes for. Convoluted and structural digital twins were used to develop new ideas or fresh-new design in engineering field. Additionally, the self-driving was also one of the application. What’s more, it may be used to detect and construct the 3D environment in space like mars or moon, helping people have a better view of what it look like outside the earth.

When it comes to how to improve the speed and the quality of reconstruction drone image, researchers have come up with many machine learning method combined with other physical approaches to do that. Including *__CNN, SO-Net, EllipsoidNet, pointwise CNN, ECC, PointNet, SGMNet, PAT, Spec-GCN, PointGrid, PointCNN, DGCNN, PCNN, PointConv, A-CNN, Point2Sequence, PointNet++, PointASNL and so on.__*
